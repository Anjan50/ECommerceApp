# ECommerceApp
## An Application for ecommerce platforms with swipe right features .


* The conventional e-commerce approach is a bit time consuming and can be more simplified andflexible to provide ease of use to the users. In our solution the goal is to build an e-commmerceapplication that heavily relies on swipe features. If users like any product they can swipe right andadd the respective product to the wishlist else they can swipe left and move on to the nextproduct in the list. This will also help to understand user's sentiment on every product no matterthey buy it or not. This will help to improve recommendation system so user won't see productswhich are lessly liked by user.
* Describe the significance of solving this problem and estimate the outcomes/benefits for thebeneficiaries listed.
* Researchers from Stanford university have analyzed that mobile applications that heavily rely onswipe functionality have higher user retentivity rates compared to apps that offer limited swipefunctionality this can bring significant increase in revenue to the company. Furthermore oneproduct is displayed at a time on the screen hence the attention of the user is focused on thatproduct only. It is more visually appealing.
